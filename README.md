## 📋 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Variables and Data Types

- Integer, Float, String, Boolean, and NoneType
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Using the `type()` function

### 2️⃣ Basic Operators

- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

### 3️⃣ String Operations

- String concatenation and formatting (f-strings)
- String slicing and indexing
- Common string methods (`upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`)

### 4️⃣ Lists and Tuples

- Creating and manipulating mutable lists
- Working with immutable tuples
- List methods (`append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`)
- Indexing and slicing

### 5️⃣ Dictionaries and Sets

- Key-value pairs in dictionaries
- Dictionary methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`)
- Unique elements in sets
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

### 6️⃣ Conditional Statements

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Nested conditionals
- Ternary operators
- Boolean expressions

### 7️⃣ Loops

- `for` loops with ranges and sequences
- `while` loops
- `enumerate()` for index-value pairs
- `break` and `continue` statements

### 8️⃣ Functions

- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters and return values
- Default arguments
- Docstrings for documentation

### 9️⃣ List Comprehensions

- Concise list creation syntax
- Conditional list comprehensions
- Dictionary and set comprehensions
- Nested comprehensions

### 🔟 Error Handling

- `try-except` blocks
- Handling specific exceptions
- `else` and `finally` clauses
- Raising custom exceptions

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Working with Files

- Reading and writing text files
- File modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)
- Context managers with `with` statement
- File methods (`read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`)

### 🎨 Notebook Styling

- Custom CSS for enhanced visual appearance
- Styled headers, code blocks, and summaries

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of using notebooks (optional but helpful)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Ensure you have Jupyter installed:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Activate your virtual environment (if using one):
    ```bash
    source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows Git Bash
    # or
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows CMD
    # or
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open `intro_to_python.ipynb` in the browser
5. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`

## 📚 How to Use This Notebook

1. **Read the explanations**: Each section begins with markdown cells explaining the concept
2. **Run the code**: Execute code cells to see the output
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code examples to test your understanding
4. **Review summaries**: Expand the collapsible summaries for quick reference
5. **Practice**: Try creating your own examples based on what you've learned

## 🎯 Learning Path

This notebook is structured to provide a logical learning progression:

1. Start with basic concepts (variables, data types, operators)
2. Move to data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
3. Learn control flow (conditionals, loops)
4. Master functions and comprehensions
5. Understand error handling and file operations

## 💡 Tips for Learners

- **Take your time**: Don't rush through the material
- **Practice actively**: Type out the examples yourself rather than just reading
- **Experiment**: Change values and see what happens
- **Use the summaries**: The collapsible sections are great for review
- **Build projects**: Apply what you learn to small projects
